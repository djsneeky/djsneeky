### 👋 Hello there!

- 🛠️ I'm an embedded software engineer at Dynetics with over two years of experience. I'm extremely passionate about my work and I love taking on tough challenges.
- 📖 I'm currently working on my Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University. I'm taking specialty courses with a focus in Computer Engineering and Signal Processing.
- ⚡ Outside of work I love to explore in the outdoors ⛰️, learn new software skills 🧰, and spend time with friends and family 👪.

### Personal Projects

I have some more projects in progress and projects not listed here, but here's some notable ones that I actually completed.

#### [C to RISC-V Compiler Design](https://github.com/djsneeky/Compiler-Project)

My version of a a C-like language to a modified RISC-V Compiler using ANTLR for parsing and AST post-processing Java classes for code generation. Simulation of the assembly is completed within a docker container to validate passing test cases.
