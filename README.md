### Personal Projects

I have some more projects in progress and projects not listed here, but here's some notable ones that I actually completed.

#### MartyCam

A web accessible camera system to view my girlfriend's fish (Marty) from anywhere in the world! This project involves using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Raspberry Pi Camera. I installed drivers for the camera, setup access to the Pi via a remote SSH connection, and configured a local web server on the Pi - all from the CLI.
